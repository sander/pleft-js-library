**Note: this library is outdated right now. Please check out the [pleft project](http://code.google.com/p/pleft/) for our latest Closure code.** If you can't use it with the GPLv3 license, please [let us know](mailto:sander@pleft.com). We are planning to release reusable parts under an Apache 2.0 license, just like Closure Library.

This library contains JavaScript code written for [Pleft](http://www.pleft.com/) the appointment planner. It depends on the [Closure Library](http://code.google.com/closure/library/) and uses [Closure Templates](http://code.google.com/closure/templates/).

### Modules ###

**Time entry** -
Based on [jQuery Time Entry](http://keith-wood.name/timeEntry.html) by Keith Wood, this is basically an `<input type="text">` enhanced to take time values. Currently, our version is less well documented and possibly less stable than Keith Wood’s original version. We also do not intend to keep this Closure version feature compatible with the jQuery version.

**Date and time picker** -
This is the calendar widget that is used on the [Pleft home page](http://www.pleft.com/). It lets the user choose multiple dates and times in an easy way.
